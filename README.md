# Debug Gatsby Build

## _Debug a failing gatsby build by creating an alternate build on digital ocean_

I have a failing build in another environment, I want to test that.

- The problems with the build are not connected to my current local configuration
- If I have a successful build, can I continue development on this new environment
- If yes, have something to present by Monday to Bacary✨Magic ✨
